# Why Codex burns a weekly limit in a day while the agent waits for the tide

This is the story of how we found an input-token leak in models running inside Codex. The leak is still there, and because of it crowds of people on X keep wondering why a $200 weekly subscription limit is gone in a day. As often happens in programming, the spark was a small bug around integers and floats, but that is only the spark and a small part of it; the real story is more interesting. Reading it with full understanding takes about 30 minutes.

## TL;DR

- Our Codex orchestrator was waiting for its child agents. The model was muse-spark 1.3 through the opencode provider (kudos to the Muse team, 1.3 is already a strong model). In 48 minutes goal mode launched 173 continuations, each rereading 120 to 470 thousand tokens of context, until the provider answered 429. From here on this is the source session.

- The cause: goal mode restarts the model 0.03 seconds after every turn and counts waiting only if the model polled a live process, while the pause tool `clock.sleep` is issued only to the recently released `gpt-6-astra`. Waiting turns into a spin: every check costs the full context.

- The price: out of 3808 sessions from July to September 2026, the 52 with goal mode ate half of 59.2 billion input tokens. An hour of waiting cost 83 to 188 million. The weekly limit of a $200 Pro account ran out fifteen times over the summer, with a median of 23 hours from the start of the window.

- What to do: the simplest option is to take `gpt-6-astra` at minimal effort as the floor for goal tasks, it is the only model with `sleep` out of the box. Otherwise turn `sleep` on through the config for the other models, wait for all child processes with a single call and put a budget on every goal. We are rolling out the second path ourselves but have not verified it at scale yet. On the Codex side: issue `sleep` whenever a goal is active and pause between continuations, the way Claude Code does.

- All numbers are for Codex 0.154 and rollouts from July, August and September 2026. Every claim about the mechanics links to the Codex source on GitHub; the rollouts themselves are not published.

## How tokens are counted

A language model doesn’t remember the conversation. Every time it needs to take a step, the entire transcript is sent to it again, and it answers with a single action: a tool call or text. If the transcript is 240 thousand tokens long, every step costs 240 thousand input tokens. It doesn’t matter that the step itself is “run `tail -n 18`”. We pay for the volume the model rereads on every step. So any piece of work costs the number of steps times the size of the context, and the only ways to make it cheaper are fewer steps or a smaller context.

### A short detour into the KV cache

To process a long context, the model computes a set of internal values for every token, called keys and values, hence KV. If the next request starts with the very same sequence of tokens, those values don’t need to be recomputed, they can be taken from the cache. Only the tail that differs has to be computed fresh.

In an agent session almost every request is the previous request plus a few new lines. So the cache hits almost every time. In the archive analyzed here, 97.8% of input tokens came from the cache.

Providers reflect this in the price. At OpenAI cached input costs 10% of the regular rate, and caching kicks in automatically on prompts longer than 1024 tokens, see the prompt caching docs. For API billing that’s good news: almost all of the reread context goes at the discounted rate.

### What about the subscription

For a ChatGPT subscription the unit of accounting is a share of a limit in a sliding window. The formula that turns tokens into that share isn’t published, and it is not a plain token-to-percent ratio. The Codex client only receives a usage percentage and a reset time from the server, visible in the protocol in the `RateLimitWindow` struct.

The cache discount most likely applies there: without it a heavy session would empty the window in minutes, not in a day. But cached input isn’t free, and when there are hundreds of millions more of it than the same work needs, it eats the window even at a discount. So from here on I show input tokens in full, as the client counts them, and don’t try to convert them into limit percentages.

The formula is not the point. However cached input is accounted for, at a discounted price in the API or through an unknown coefficient in the subscription, the current behavior multiplies it by hundreds and thousands where one call would do. An hour of waiting that could cost half a million tokens costs tens to hundreds of millions. At any coefficient that is massive overuse.

In the same caching docs OpenAI says plainly that for API rate limits cached tokens count as regular ones. The only thing we know about the subscription comes from experience: sessions where 98% of the input came from the cache still blew through the weekly limit. So from here on I count input tokens in full, no discount: they appear to be what decides when you hit the wall. Struck out after a Reddit discussion: the API rule is about per-minute request limits, not the plan, and carrying it over to the subscription was a mistake.

## What “waiting” means

An agent often has to wait for something external: a build, tests, another agent. There are two ways to do it.

Notification. The agent takes one step, “tell me when it’s done”, and releases the turn. While we wait there are no steps, so there is no cost. When the event happens, one message arrives, and that’s one new step.

```
launched → released the turn → silence, zero tokens → "done" → one step
```

Polling. The agent checks periodically on its own: is it done yet? Every check is a step, every step is the full context.

```
checked → 240k → "no" → waited → checked → 240k → "no" → ...
```

Hence the formula the whole text is built around:

```
cost of waiting = number of checks × size of context
```

Polling isn’t evil in itself. If the agent can sleep between checks without spending a step, polling costs the same as a notification. The trouble starts when it can’t sleep.

### A known pause and an unknown one

A simple test. Ask the model: “write one, and five seconds later write two”. It will do it correctly and cheaply: one `sleep 5` call in the shell, the command blocks the turn for five seconds, returns, the model writes “two”. One step, the context paid for once.

Now ask: “wait until the build finishes”. The duration is unknown. Could be a minute, could be three hours. The model can’t do a single three-hour `sleep`: if the build finishes in a minute it sleeps through the result, and if it doesn’t finish it runs into the ceiling on how long one command may take. So it picks an interval, say 30 seconds, and loops: sleep, check, sleep, check.

```
known pause:    1 sleep               = 1 step
unknown pause:  N × (sleep + check)   = 2N steps
```

The model waits five seconds correctly because it was told how long. For an unknown pause it needs a different primitive: “wake me when it happens”. Everything that follows is about whether the model has one.

### In async/await terms

For programmers (sorry, vibe coders) it’s easier to think of this as an async task. A model turn is a task run, the end of the turn is the point where the task yields control. There are three ways to wait for an external event, and all three are familiar from asynchronous code.

```
// 1. await: the task is suspended, the runtime keeps the continuation
let result = await child.finished     // zero calls while we wait
handle(result)                        // one call on the event

// 2. sleep-poll: suspend for a fixed interval
while !child.finished {
await sleep(45s)                  // one call per interval
}

// 3. spin: the task can't suspend at all
while !child.finished {
poll()                            // call after call, no pauses
}
```

In ordinary code a spin-wait just heats one core. For an agent it’s worse: the model’s memory is its context, and every iteration of the spin rereads that whole memory. It’s a `while` loop that copies the entire process heap on every pass.

Which of the three variants the model gets is decided by the dispatcher that launches its turns and by the set of tools it was handed. Next, what Codex hands out.

## How Codex waits

Codex recently got the right tool. It’s called `clock.sleep`: “sleep this many milliseconds, wake me earlier if something arrives”. It landed in PR 28429 and shipped in 0.141.0 on June 18, 2026; it has gone by the name `clock.sleep` since 0.143.0 on July 8. The implementation in `sleep.rs` does exactly that: sleeps for up to 12 hours and is interrupted by new input. This is the second variant from the list above, and for waiting it’s almost as good as the first.

Only the model doesn’t get it. The tool is registered by a rule in `spec_plan.rs`: it’s there if the model’s catalog entry declares `clock` support, or if it has been force-enabled in the config. In the built-in model catalog `clock` is present on one model, `gpt-6-astra`. For `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4` and every model on a custom provider the list is empty. Meanwhile `codex features list` says `sleep_tool stable true`, but that’s a feature flag, not evidence that the tool is in the request. Across the archive of 3808 sessions `sleep` was called 420 times, and 418 of those were `gpt-6-astra`.

Why the tool is issued to one model isn’t written in the sources, but there are hints. The catalog field is called `experimental_supported_tools`, and the default mode is annotated in the code as “preserve the existing model defaults”. It looks like a staged rollout: the tool itself runs on the client and asks nothing of the model. `gpt-6-astra` has a second experimental tool in the same field, `send_user_message_async`, which lets it write to the user without ending the turn. Together they describe a model that was taught to work in long background sessions: wait, wake up, report along the way. This looks like a new line of behavior that was measured on the new model and not attributed to the older ones. There is a reason for caution: a model that wasn’t trained to pick a sleep duration may fall asleep instead of working or spin `sleep 1` in a loop. The logic has a hole in it: goal mode is on for every model, while the tool without which goal mode turns into a spin is on for one.

### What is left without sleep

The only way to wait is to run a command in the shell: `sleep 30`, `tail` on a log, whatever. That’s a step, so it’s the full context. And the step has a ceiling on its length. The shell in Codex runs through unified exec: the command starts in a pseudo-terminal, and the tool hands control back to the model on a `yield_time_ms` timer. The default is 10 seconds, the maximum 30, see the constants in `unified_exec/mod.rs` and the default in `handlers/unified_exec.rs`. If the process is still alive, the model gets a session id and can keep reading its output with an empty-input `write_stdin`. That empty call can wait longer, up to five minutes. So even without `sleep` the model has a legitimate way to pay one call for five minutes of waiting.

In the source session that path was closed. muse-spark was running through a custom provider and passed numbers in tool arguments as floats: `60000.0` instead of `60000`. The Codex parser expects an integer and rejects the call. The archive shows it across every session on this model: 10 of 10 `write_stdin` calls and 23 of 25 calls with `yield_time_ms` failed with an error like `invalid type: floating point 60000.0, expected u64`. It also means a force-enabled `sleep` wouldn’t help it: its `duration_ms` argument is an integer too.

That’s where the 10-second ceiling comes from. When the model launches a command, Codex hands control back on the `yield_time_ms` timer, 10 seconds by default. The timer can only be extended with a number in the argument, and numbers from this model don’t get through. The empty `write_stdin`, which can wait up to five minutes, fails for the same reason. So one trip to the shell never lasts longer than 10 seconds, whatever the model writes.

In practice the model never even reached that ceiling. Its poll was a snapshot: the command read the child process’s event log and came back within a second. The rest of the turn went into two model calls, one to launch the poll and one to write “no changes”. The median turn was ten seconds, the mean seventeen counting the longer turns, and goal launches the next one right away. Over 48 minutes that added up to 173 such turns and 466 model calls, each call rereading 120 to 470 thousand tokens. In total, 149 million input tokens in 48 minutes, or 188 million per hour.

For comparison, on the official `gpt-5.6-sol` the same loop in session A cost 83 million per hour: there the model waited 30 seconds per call, the ceiling for a running command. In session B, 20 million: the model kept reading output with an empty `write_stdin` and got five minutes of pause per call. The longer the pause inside a single call, the cheaper the hour. The source session took the last brake off the loop, and that’s how the bug became visible.

## What goal mode adds

Without goal the model has an escape hatch: end the turn and go quiet. Even without `sleep` that’s a free pause. The human comes back, writes something, we continue. In async terms it’s the first variant, await: the task yielded control, and nobody wakes it until an event happens.

Goal mode removes that hatch too. As soon as the thread becomes idle, the goal extension immediately sends the model a new turn: “continue working toward the goal”. It’s visible in `extension.rs`: the `on_thread_idle` handler calls `continue_if_idle` from `runtime.rs`, which starts a turn right away. No backoff, no counter of empty continuations. The token budget per goal is unset by default.

Ralph is here for a reason: any goal mode is essentially a Ralph loop, `while true; do codex "continue"; done`, just built into the product. The face fits.

The word “immediately” is measurable here. In the source session, between the end of one turn and the start of the next there were 0.02 to 0.05 seconds, median 0.03. A turn usually lasted ten seconds: exactly what the model needs to read the context, call one poll and write “no changes”. The polling frequency was set by the model’s response latency and nothing else.

There is an important moment in this picture. At 23:50 I asked the model why it checks so often. The model answered, translated from Russian: “The goal contract requires every turn to either move the work or prove a verified wait by live-polling the runs”, and promised to poll less often. 0.3 seconds after its answer, goal mode launched the next turn. The promise could not be kept: the model doesn’t control when it gets called next.

The text of that contract lives in `continuation.md`. It has a paragraph about waiting. Waiting only counts if in this turn the model polled a live process. “I’m waiting” without a poll counts as no progress. The model itself can only move the goal to `complete` or `blocked`, and `blocked` is allowed after three identical blockers in a row, while waiting for child processes doesn’t count as a blocker. Only a human can pause the goal.

The result is a trap:

- you can’t end the turn and wait, you get restarted at once;

- the restart counts as “no progress” unless you poll a process;

- so every turn has to poll something;

- every poll costs the full context.

The model follows the requirement literally. The requirement is phrased so that the behavior that is correct by the contract is the most expensive in tokens. In async terms the goal extension is a dispatcher with a single rule: the queue is empty, enqueue the same task again. And the contract forbids the task to suspend in any way other than polling. Together that’s a spin, the third variant on the list.

## How the same idea works in Claude Code

Claude Code has the same mode, also called `/goal`: you set a condition and Claude works until it’s met. The dispatcher is what differs. Per the docs, after every turn a separate small model checks the condition, and only then does a new turn start. If a background command or a subagent is still running, the check is deferred and their result arrives as a new turn. When background work drags on, the first check-in comes after 30 minutes, then the interval doubles, and there are no more than three check-ins without a human. Several turns in a row without a single tool call stop the loop with a warning. In Codex the answer to each of these cases is the same: a new turn in 0.03 seconds.

The line about background work is the key one. That’s the await from the first variant: the task yielded control, the dispatcher holds the continuation and wakes it on the event. The background primitives themselves are there too: Bash has a background mode with a notification on completion, subagents have one as well, and Monitor watches a stream of events and wakes the model on every output line. The `/loop` docs plainly recommend Monitor over polling on a timer because it’s cheaper in tokens.

That’s why this loop doesn’t show up in Claude Code sessions: the dispatcher knows how to wait for events and how to slow down when the wait gets long. The Codex dispatcher only knows how to restart.

Model training has nothing to do with it. In Claude Code the wrapper watches the background process: when it finishes, the wrapper puts a “task finished” message into the conversation and calls the model. Codex has similar primitives, the thread queue and `sleep` interrupted by input, but the completion of a shell command never becomes a message; the model has to read the output itself. The whole difference is who waits: a wrapper that wakes the model, or a model that asks on its own.

The Claude Code sources are closed, so we looked at the mechanics through ClawCodex, a third-party Python port that carries the TypeScript reference over file by file with the original line numbers. The notification path there is short: `background.py` waits for the process and puts a `<task-notification>` envelope on the queue, `agent_server.py` drains the queue between turns and hands it to the model as a single turn. While the process runs, the model isn’t called. Goal mode isn’t fully reproduced in the port, so for that the docs remain the source.

## Empty turns

There’s an even simpler version of the same trap. The model ends the turn having done nothing, say it wrote “waiting”. Goal restarts it at once. It does nothing again. Restart again. The logs have chains of four such turns in 20 seconds. In one session fourteen empty turns cost 77 million input tokens: nothing happened, and the context was reread fourteen times. This is exactly the case Claude Code guards against by stopping after several turns without tool calls.

## Why this hits orchestrators hardest

Our orchestrator works like this: it doesn’t write code itself, it hands tasks to child agents, each in its own branch with its own context. That parallelizes the work and keeps the parent’s context from bloating. But the parent has to wait for the child processes, and there are usually many of them.

With one child process it’s still cheap. There’s a command that blocks the turn until the process finishes, and it’s the same case as `sleep 5`: one step, except the duration is set by an event rather than a timer. The ceiling for a single call in Codex is about five minutes, that’s how long an empty `write_stdin` can wait, so a three-hour process costs about 36 calls in a row. That’s 12 steps per hour, not 270.

With two or more, everything changes. While the orchestrator is blocked on process A, process B can finish, crash or ask for help, and the orchestrator won’t see it. If all it needed was the fact “both finished”, it could wait for A, then B, and that would still be cheap. But the orchestrator has to react along the way: accept a result, lift a lock, restart the one that crashed. So it doesn’t dare block for long and replaces the block with a short loop: look at A, look at B, wait, again. Bottom line: one child process is a known wait, N processes without a shared barrier is polling. The sessions below show it literally: the orchestrator knew about the blocking wait and used it 31 times, but between the blocks it still walked through both processes’ logs.

The same thing happens in any pattern where an agent starts several long processes and can’t get notified: several CI runs, a build and a deploy in parallel, several remote jobs. An orchestrator with child processes is just the most common case.

Codex has its own barrier over several child agents, the `wait_agent` tool, described as “pass multiple ids to wait for whichever finishes first”, see `multi_agents_spec.rs`. But it only sees agents that Codex itself spawned through `spawn_agent`. Our orchestrator’s child processes don’t exist for it.

## What the model had in the source session

Here are the ways to wait that a model in Codex has in theory, and what happened to each of them in the source session.

| Way to wait  | What happened 

| `clock.sleep`  | Not issued: a model on a custom provider has no `clock` in the catalog 

| `wait_agent`, the barrier over several child agents  | The child processes aren’t Codex agents, the tool can’t see them; in the next session that same night an attempt at a native `spawn_agent` returned `unsupported call` 

| Empty-input `write_stdin`, up to 5 minutes per call  | The only attempt failed: `floating point 36429.0, expected i32` 

| `yield_time_ms` longer than 10 seconds  | The only attempt failed: `floating point 60000.0, expected u64` 

| `sleep` in the shell  | Ten times, 4 to 8 seconds each; anything over 10 seconds would have been cut off by unified exec 

| The blocking flag on the watch command  | Never used, and it wouldn’t have helped: the same 10-second ceiling 

| End the turn and wait  | A new turn in 0.03 seconds 

Five of the seven doors were shut by the environment, one the model never found, and one was locked by the contract. What remained is what we saw in the log: one poll per turn. Of the session’s 181 turns, 135 consisted of exactly one such command.

This picture also gives us a natural experiment. While goal is active, the orange bars come as a solid wall, each taller than the last, because the context grows. At 00:03 the provider answers 429, the turn fails with an error, and the loop freezes for an hour until I come back. At 01:34 I resume the goal, and the polling starts again, every 12 seconds. At 01:35 I press Ctrl-C, the goal pauses, and eight minutes later I say “let’s continue without the goal”. Then five calls, the work is done, the session ends. Same context, same model, same task; only the dispatcher changed.

## What the sessions showed

I took every Codex rollout from two machines for July, August and September: 3808 files, each one thread, child threads included. They hold 59.2 billion input tokens and 129 million output tokens, with 97.8% of the input from the cache. CLI versions from 0.144 to 0.154, mostly `gpt-5.6-sol`, plus `terra`, `luna`, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, as well as Qwen 3.6 and muse models through custom providers.

Goal mode was on in 52 sessions out of 3808, one and a half percent. Here is what they weigh.

One and a half percent of the sessions ate half the tokens: 29.2 billion out of 59.2. The seven most expensive sessions in the archive, 1.8 to 5.7 billion each, all had goal mode on. The heaviest session without it weighs 1.2 billion. Without forced continuation the model ended its turn and waited for the human, and that’s free.

And here is what it meant for the limit. Every `token_count` event in the rollouts carries a snapshot of the account limits, and it shows: over ten weeks from July to September the weekly window came up to 99% thirteen times and hit 100% eleven times, and the “You’ve hit your usage limit” error appears on 28 calendar days. From the start of a window to 99% took a median of 25 hours, the fastest case 7 hours, the slowest 93. The five-hour window ran out twice over the same period; it was almost always the weekly one that hit. At the 83 to 188 million input tokens per hour that waiting costs in the sessions below, a day yields two to four billion. Hence “in a day” in the title: that’s the median.

Here is one of the goal sessions turn by turn. Blue turns were started by a human or by the orchestrator itself, orange ones by goal mode.

The orange bars are hours of log polling. The tallest, 71 million tokens, is a single three-hour turn with 439 tool calls, mostly `tail` on the child processes’ logs. On the right, four nearly invisible orange bars are empty continuations within 20 seconds.

The main number: what one hour of waiting costs at comparable context.

Session A waited 7.8 hours and spent 650 million input tokens on it, 271 steps per hour. Session B waited 92 hours and spent 1.85 billion, 43 steps per hour, with the model running `sleep 30` through the shell 61 times. The source session made 466 calls in 48 minutes of goal loop, 590 per hour, and spent 149 million. The top bar is an estimate for the same context with a notification: one or two steps per event.

Between them lies a measured case with `sleep`. The archive has two goal sessions on `gpt-6-astra`, the one model that gets the tool. The model used it, 60 and 129 times, sleeping 45 seconds per call. An hour of waiting cost it 10 to 15 million input tokens at 55 to 100 calls. That’s 6 to 18 times cheaper than the spin, and still 20 to 30 times more expensive than a notification: goal mode kept restarting it after every turn, 600 and 443 times per session, and it didn’t sleep for long. Sleep lowers the price of the loop but doesn’t remove the loop.

One more detail from the data. Qwen 3.6 through a local llama.cpp showed the same pattern: 21 of the 22 turns in its goal session were pure polling. The pause tool is gated by the model catalog, the provider has nothing to do with it, and it isn’t limited to one muse model.

## What to do about it

On the Codex side it’s a few small changes, and each has a ready-made example in the neighboring product.

- Register `clock.sleep` whenever the thread has an active goal, regardless of the model catalog. Weaker but also workable: make `always_on` the default when goals are enabled.

- Add a delay between continuations when the previous goal turn was a waiting turn or an empty one. Claude Code does it at 30 minutes with a doubling interval and a cap of three automatic check-ins, and stops the loop after several turns without tools. Right now `continue_if_idle` starts the turn at once.

- Accept `60000.0` where `60000` is expected. Models on custom providers write numbers that way, and because of it not one waiting tool works for them.

- One line in `continuation.md`: name `clock.sleep` and a long `write_stdin` as acceptable forms of a verified wait, otherwise even a model with the tool will go poll the shell.

### How to check your own sessions

Every table in this text can be reproduced on your own rollouts with one script: codex-rollout-audit, a single Python file with no dependencies. It reads `~/.codex/sessions`, sends nothing anywhere, and prints the per-session summary, the limit exhaustion episodes, a per-turn view of one session and the count of rejected float arguments.

### How to turn sleep on for yourself

The flag lives in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```
[features]
sleep_tool = { mode = "always_on" }
```

The key is described in `feature_configs.rs`; the `always_on` mode registers the tool regardless of the model catalog. After a Codex restart `clock.sleep` is in the tool set for any model. The easiest check is to ask the model to sleep five seconds via `clock.sleep` and see whether the call shows up in the response. Three caveats. On `gpt-6-astra` nothing needs enabling: it declares `clock` in the catalog, and in the default mode the tool registers itself. For the other models the flag only adds the tool to the set. The model wasn’t taught to use it sensibly: it may keep polling the shell or fall asleep instead of working. For models on custom providers that write `60000.0` instead of `60000`, the tool won’t work until number serialization is fixed.

At home we turned `sleep` on through the config, we’re teaching the orchestrator to wait for all its child processes with a single call, and we put a budget on every goal. The formula is the same: number of checks times size of context. Until the model is given a way to wait without spending a step, the one who waits is the one who pays.
